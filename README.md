## Date:10/11/25
## Reg. No:212223220029

## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Topic 1: Article on Climate Change
First Prompt & Output (Basic Prompt)
## Prompt 1 (Basic):

Write an article about climate change.

## Output 1:

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature and weather patterns caused primarily by human activities. Increasing greenhouse gas emissions from industries, vehicles, and deforestation are warming the planet. The consequences include rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and extreme weather events such as floods and droughts. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation, renewable energy adoption, and sustainable lifestyle choices.

Refined Prompts & Outputs (Applying Prompt Patterns Step-by-Step)
## Query Decomposition
## Prompt 2:

Write an article on climate change that includes:
• What is climate change?
• Causes
• Impacts
• Solutions
• Conclusion

## Output 2:

## Title: Understanding Climate Change – A Global Environmental Crisis

Climate change refers to significant long-term alterations in global temperatures and weather patterns. It is primarily driven by human-induced factors.

## Causes:
The major contributors include burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial emissions, and agricultural activities that release greenhouse gases.

## Impacts:
Climate change causes heatwaves, rising sea levels, ecosystem disruption, food shortages, and loss of biodiversity.

## Solutions:
Transition to renewable energy, afforestation, sustainable agriculture, and global policy reforms are essential actions.

## Conclusion:
Climate change requires immediate action from governments and individuals to protect the planet for future generations.

## Decision-Making
## Prompt 3:

Choose one focus for the article — either “Causes of Climate Change” or “Solutions to Climate Change.” Write the article emphasizing only that aspect.

## Output 3:

## Title: Key Solutions to Combat Climate Change

Addressing climate change requires strategic and global actions. Renewable energy sources such as solar and wind reduce dependence on fossil fuels. Reforestation helps absorb carbon dioxide, while sustainable farming minimizes methane release. Governments must enforce emission regulations and encourage green innovations.
